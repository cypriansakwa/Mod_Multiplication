This Rust program shows how to do a modular arithmetic computation that requires the exponentiation of huge numbers.
It handles huge integers with the i128 type and computes the final result through exponentiation and a modulo operation.

Modular arithmetic is a frequent operation in number theory and cryptography, and this example shows how it might be applied in Rust.
